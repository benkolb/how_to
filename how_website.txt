How I created this website

1. Set up homepage with github pages
- follow tutorial on github
https://pages.github.com/
Main steps: 
- create repository (repo) with the name username.github.io
- I use the "github for windows" programme (select folder on hard disk and publish)
- put an index.html file into the folder and commit
Notes and problems encountered:
- Wait some time! Github says it might need up to 10 minutes, and these feel even longer when constantly refreshing the browser...
- Publish the repository BEFORE you add the index.html!
- After error suggesting you debug the state of your repo, just delete the hidden .git folder!

2. use some basic html
