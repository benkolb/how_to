how to create a new subpage (e.g. ".../codes")
1. create new repository on github
2. refer simply to the username.github.io folder on desktop. Github should create a subfolder with the same name as the repo. Then commit some file in there (e.g. an index.html file for this subpage).
[3. Add a readme file if you want.]

route I: manually create gh-pages
route II: with preset layouts by github 
4. Go to "Settings" and "Automatic Page Generator".
5. Follow http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/create-github-page/
[6. If you want to go back to layouting by index.html: Delete all the files added by github manually (and replace github's index.html with your own). The theme "Minimal" seems to minimise the amount of files you have to delete manually.
6. Give github some minute(s) to activate your changes.
